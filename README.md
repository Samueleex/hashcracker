Hashcracker in Python!

### [Read this guide!](https://ethicalhacking.freeflarum.com/d/1108-hash-cracking-in-python)

# How to install?

- `git clone https://github.com/Samueleex/hashcracker`
- `cd hashcracker`
- `python3 cracker.py`

Put the hash to process in hashes.txt!

(You can change the wordlist).

I also added the inhash.py file which does the reverse (from word to hash).
